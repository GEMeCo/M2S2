About
-----
M2S2 is a simple C++ header only library for linear algebra applied to mechanics of solids and structures. It was developed primarly to help FEM coding.

Citation
--------
  Whether it was used in whole or parts, citation is a must!

 This library is in Zenodo - thus, we got a DOI: [doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.)
 
 (:construction: We'll get there, eventually :construction:).

Features
--------
- v0.2.0: Dynamic mechanical analysis.
    - :boom: Newmark-beta time step integration method.

- v0.1.0: Dyadics and Matrices
    - :boom: M2S2::Dyadic2S - Symmetric 2nd rank tensors of 2 or 3 dimensional vector space;
    - :boom: M2S2::Dyadic2N - Asymmetric 2nd rank tensors of 2 or 3 dimensional vector space;
    - :boom: M2S2::Dyadic4S - Symmetric 4th rank tensors of 2 or 3 dimensional vector space;
    - :boom: M2S2::Dyadic4C - 4th order tensor for orthotropic constitutive matrices, in either 2 or 3 dimensional vector space;
    - :boom: M2S2::MatrixS - Symmetric square matrix of any order.
    - :boom: M2S2::MatrixS - 2nd rank matrices of any size, even not square.

Resources
---------
M2S2 doesn't have any dependencies other than the C++ standard library.

Building and Running
--------------------
1. Clone the source code
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/GEMeCo/O2P2.git`

2. Just include the main header file (don't forget to setup including directories). That's all there is to it. Good luck :innocent:.
`#include "m2s2.h"`

Documentation
-------------
Software documentation is made directly from annotated sources by doxygen. Use doxywizard to create the documentation.
